# Contribution Guide


To get started contributing to the Promptify repository, which includes prompts, code, and documentation, please refer to this step-by-step guide.

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account to create a copy of the repository associated with your account, enabling you to make changes without altering the original.

2. To create a new branch in your repository, run the following command (replacing "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME" with your actual GitHub username):
```bash
git checkout -b YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/feature-name
```
This branch will be where you can make changes and additions.

3. It's now time to implement the modifications you want to make to the repository. You can add new files, modify existing files or delete files that are no longer necessary. Once you have completed these changes, you can stage them by utilizing the command:
```bash
git add .
``` 
This command will stage all the changes that have been made.

4. Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message. This message should briefly describe the changes you've made. You can do this by running the command:
```bash
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

5. Push your changes to the branch you created in step 2. You can do this by running the command:
```bash
git push origin YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/feature-name
```

6. Finally, go back to the Promptify repository on GitHub and create a pull request. Describe your changes and ask for them to be reviewed and merged into the main repository.

7. Before starting with the above steps, it is important to note that you should have a local copy of the repository on your machine. You can clone the repository by running the command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/promptslab/Promptify.git
```
